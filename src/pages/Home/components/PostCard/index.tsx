					Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one
					language to another. This article attempts to list the built-in data structures available
					in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to build other data
					structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn. Dynamic typing
					JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not
					directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and
					re-assigned) values of all types: let foo = 42; // foo is now a number foo = 'bar'; // foo
					is now a string foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
				</p>
